    "Our goal is to determine the most superior Pittsburgh neighborhood by using data provided by the WPDC. and a cruical factor to determining which neighborhood is the best is if its visitor friendly. Someone new to the city would probably want to go somewhere photo friendly to remember the trip by, so a neighborhood's visuals are key. Additionally, an important factor to any trip is accessbility to food since its difficult to prepare meals in a hotel room or taxing have to meal prep in an airbnb."
